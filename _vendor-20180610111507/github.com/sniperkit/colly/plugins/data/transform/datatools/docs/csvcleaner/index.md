# USAGE

	csvcleaner [OPTIONS]

## SYNOPSIS


csvcleaner normalizes a CSV file based on the options selected. It
helps to address issues like variable number of columns, leading/trailing
spaces in columns, and non-UTF-8 encoding issues.

By default input is expected from standard in and output is sent to 
standard out (errors to standard error). These can be modified by
appropriate options. The csv file is processed as a stream of rows so 
minimal memory is used to operate on the file.
